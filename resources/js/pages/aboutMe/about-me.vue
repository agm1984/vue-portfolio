                        I'll keep this short. I've been programming for about four years (calc: current year minus 2017),
                        but I've been working with iOS, Android, and web apps since 2013. I would say I discovered my passion
                        for coding around that time. I'm an autodidact-type person. All I need is a topic and an impetus, and
                        I can start researching it. Google really is a magical thing.

                        My list of hobbies is quite short because my main hobby is programming. Beyond that,
                        I enjoy working out. I've been working out for the past 10 years. I didn't go to the gym much in 2019,
                        but I've been going again four times a week, and it feels great.

                        I have a 700 horsepower 1993 Toyota Supra, so when the engine isn't broken and it's clean,
                        you can find me out driving with my friends, listening to music, and finding new places to visit.

                        What can I say? I like to use Mealy finite state machines, predicates and booleans,
                        and immutable functional-reactive programming (FRP) styles (ie: map, reduce, filter, etc).

                    <a-paragraph light>
                        I often think in two modes: push and pull. Pushing is like doing & triggering.
                        Pulling is like listening & acting. In my opinion, this is much of where the
                        "functional-reactive" comes from in FRP. Functional can be pushing, and reactive can be pulling.

                                balancing salty, sweet, sour, and hot.

                                Fitness & nutrition has been a way of life for me for the past ten years. A healthy mind and
