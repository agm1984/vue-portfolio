            Inside setup I have used this but the canvas size is not according to the div size.
            How do I know this? Well, When I try to use my mouse to move the ellipse or rectangle on
            the screen on any sketch, they are off from the mouse cursor. It means the canvas is
            stretching which is clearly visible in case of ellipse. Why the canvas is not taking
            the siz eof the div?
